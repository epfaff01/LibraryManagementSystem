# Library Management System

## Overview

I created this program for my CS 067 final project.

Welcome to the Library Management System, a Java-based application that allows users to efficiently manage a library catalog with diverse books. This system employs various classes, each designed to handle specific aspects of the library, including different genres of books.

## Features

- **Book Class**: Represents a standard book with essential properties, such as title, author, year published, and the number of pages.
  
- **Genre-specific Classes**: Specialized classes (MysteryBook, NonfictionBook, RomanceBook, SciFiBook) extend the Book class, offering tailored functionalities for each genre.

- **BookDonationManager**: Manages the process of handling book donations, guiding users through the input of book details, and seamlessly integrating donated books into the library catalog.

- **Library Class**: Represents the library's catalog, complete with methods for printing the catalog and adding donated books to specific genre categories.
